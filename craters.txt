High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) nadir and colour channel data taken on 19 June
2011 by ESA’s Mars Express have been combined to form a natural-colour view of the
Danielson and Kalocsa craters and their environment in the Arabia Terra region. Centred
at around 7°N and 353°E, this image has a ground resolution of about 26 m per pixel. The
image shows the yardangs bisected by the darker dune field in Danielson crater.
